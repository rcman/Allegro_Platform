# Allegro_Platform
An Allegro 2D Platform I was working on


This is not much but a small allegro program I wrote(badly) that makes a screen. I put something together that looks really nice
but is not playable. The character moves but there is no interaction. I just really like how it looks.

You'll need to install Allegro and SCONS and there is an SConstuct file there. All you need to do is run scons. I compiled this in Linux
but I am sure you can port it elsewhere.
